## What is ts-runtime-checks?

ts-runtime-checks is a typescript transformer which automatically generates validation code from your types. Think of it as a validation library like 
[ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/typescript.html) and [zod](https://zod.dev/), except it completely relies on the typescript compiler, and generates
 vanilla javascript code on demand. This comes with a lot of advantages:

-   It's just types - no boilerplate or schemas needed.
-   Only validate where you see fit.
-   Code is generated during the transpilation phase, and can be easily optimized by V8.
-   Powerful - built on top of typescript's type system, which is turing-complete.
